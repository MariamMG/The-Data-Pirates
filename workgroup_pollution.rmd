## R Markdown
Reading all data to R environment

```{r cars}
setwd("D:/Documentos/IE - MBD/1st Term/R Programming/workgroup/workgroup data")
temp <- list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
whole_data <- data.frame(day = character(), hour = character(), station = character(), parameter = character(), value = double())
for(i in 1:length(temp)){
  whole_data <- rbind(whole_data,read.csv(temp[i]))
}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
